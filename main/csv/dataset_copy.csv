924,Misinformation. The three nuclear power plants left online right now have been scheduled to go down at the end of the year for a long time which means that there are no more fuel rods available for them. Procuring new ones takes upwards of 12 months so no short term option to deal with Vladolf and the general direction for German energy generation is 100% renewables so going through the whole process of restarting those processes to get the nuclear plants up and running again would be a waste of time and energy. Saying that the coal plants are reopened in order to shut down those nuclear plants is definitely a misrepresentation of the facts.,German energy generation;Vladolf;fuel rods,61
925,It just seems odd to me that in an age of environmental awareness rejecting the electric vehicle and glass bottle is the direction we went in. Using glass bottles for fast-moving consumer products is probably worse for the environment. Also the cold chain is broken I know from when I used to be a milk boy fresh out of school in the mid 90's the bottles of milk would be loaded up at about 11pm then placed back in the fridge at the depot at about 8am that's 9 hours out of cold storage. Not so good when the overnight temperature in the summer is well into double digits.,Using glass bottles;cold chain;electric vehicle,55

931,Say somehow we succeed and now have access to unlimited clean energy. What happens then ? Do we swap over to this new energy ?

934,I like nuclear physics. I agree with everyone here saying it's more reasonable than fossil fuels. Another problem with nuclear energy is it's too costly at the moment and the safety regulations at least in the US are too tight and therefore add up to the cost. These make it unviable for poorer countries. I think nuclear can potentially see a revival though in the next 20-30 years as a new modular system of reactors is being developed that will make things cheaper and safer.,nuclear energy;safety regulations,46

939,Of course nuclear energy still has the potential risk. But more investment can help people to develop a more safe model in the future. The problem is that I just all into nuclear energy stocks and I am wallstreetbet gambling addict. Which meant I shouldn’t be able to make money. And the major reason that trigger dip in nuclear stock are mostly nuclear power plant accidents. Which meant I should sell cover call on it so there won’t be a nuclear accident.,nuclear energy stocks;wallstreetbet,41
940,In many cases though people aren't going to replace a gas guzzling SUV with an e-bike. Replacing one ICE SUV with an EV SUV saves a lot more oil than replacing a lot of gas mopeds with e-bikes.

But we absolutely need EVs and other vehicles for the large number of situations where people can't or won't downsize so radically.,EVs;small vehicles,47
941,A year later the EPA then headed by President Donald Trump appointee Scott Pruitt halted the regulatory process quietly dropping the proposed rule from its schedule of pending regulatory actions.

Only the tip of the iceberg,“EPA” grants,43
945,I don’t get lectured. Honestly how is this happening to you ? Over 10 years of EV ownership I’ve had one guy mention I would experience terrible battery degradation and how my Tesla model 3 would only have 50% of the original range within 1 year I was already at 1 year of ownership when we had lunch together and he brought this up . Thanks guy uh I don’t care what your opinion is. I got facts.,EV ownership;Tesla model 3,40
946,So Toyota made a very big deal about how the numbers with EVs just don’t add up at the moment when you factor in how much goes into the batteries. Sure you benefit from a car that is almost 100% efficient but it doesn’t make up for the negatives from the batteries. While we wait for the manufacturing to improve hybrids make the most sense for this transition needing much less lithium. [read about it here paywall,EVs;hybrids,34
947,It really bothers me to see his hatred and lies influence the older members of my family.

950,Probably generic and over-used question but: Have you watched the HBO series Chernobyl ? Do you know anything about the severity of the injuries that were received as a result of Chernobyl and what the dangers of that are today ?

951,They won't be 100% until they can meet 100% of use cases. When an EV can carry 4 adults plus 200 pounds of gear while towing a 7 500 pound trailer 300+ miles before needing a recharge with 15 minutes or less to fully recharge let's talk. Until then there will be a need for gas. Maybe the solution will be powered trailers with their own batteries but the use case is real.,EV;gas;powered trailers,39
952,The fight against Climate Change is already over and has been for some time. It could have been an opportunity to take the time to do it right change our habits evolve. We had almost half a century to do it when the first sign came up. But we waited too long and then chose solutions that are just more of the same mistakes we've been doing for decades. Nothing will change.,Climate Change;solutions,27
953,Historically most road and transportation infrastructure has been funded by taxing gas. Since electric vehicles use less gas but still create the same amount of wear and tear this is becoming a budgetary issue as more electric vehicles enter circulation. It's not some big oil conspiracy or middle finger to electric vehicles. It's a straightforward way to address an increasing budgetary shortfall and distribute the tax burden more evenly amongst drivers.,big oil;tax burden,44
954,The thing is that countries who have nuclear power have potential to make nuclear arsenal which is why the us don't want middle eastern countries to have it. I agree it's kind of a boogie man but nuclear energy although safe it can be easily used for evil means. And people don't realize that catastrophies caused by nuclear energy may be scarce yes but they cause gigantic negative outcomes.,middle eastern countries;nuclear power,38
955,Not saying I'm against Nuclear but the way I look at it we have a viable source of 5 000 000 000 years of clean energy. Solar is absolutely just as viable as nuclear if not more. Our CURRENT solar technology allows us to produce 5x the energy we use if we put them on existing rooftops so as to not take up land space.,Solar,32
956,I don't imagine anyone her actually believes that China has shut down any coal fired power plants ! The Chinese govt has mandated the construction of 28 new coal fired power plants. Now I imagine they will likely more efficient than the ones already on line. China has more coal than anyone else on the planet they are not going to quit using that resource.,Chinese govt;new coal fired power plants,35
957,The US currently has a major clean energy problem: There is more electricity from solar power alone waiting to get on the grid than the entire amount of energy currently on the grid. To combat the climate crisis and increase the amount of cheap energy from clean sources like wind and solar the US needs more modern high-voltage transmission lines. How is this possible ?,high-voltage transmission lines;solar power,38
958,In addition to concerns about climate change and the future in general I think a lot of younger people are rejecting the notion that you need to have kids to have a fulfilling life. I have a lot of friends who opted for sterilization in their 20's or early 30's. Kids involve massive amounts of sacrifice of time money sleep freedom and relaxation.,have kids,33
959,I agree that nobody should like climate change deniers but the idea that voting for a party that is trying to lower the price of gasoline is going to save us seems a bit far fetched. In the US it seems like your only option to make progress on climate change is to throw out both major parties for someone like the Greens.,Greens;both major parties;idea,34

966,All states except QLD have independent EPAs. Nationally the The Clean Energy Regulator is an independent statutory authority. So the regulatory framework for pollution waste and climate change is pretty good in Australia. The jurisdiction and powers of a national EPA would have to be very carefully defined so that it worked in synergy with the well established state regulators.,regulatory framework;state regulators,34
967,EVs are the future no matter what Trump or MAGA republicans believe. They are simply delaying the inevitable and setting the US back years in EV transition development and job growth.,EVs;MAGA republicans,19
968,With no safe storage place for nuclear waste and climate change affecting the weather to be hotter [and thusly cooling water gets to hot] and even [nuclear power plants all over europe have to shutdown on a regular] due to heat.,nuclear power,24
969,Like I would say awesome that is great ! But they keep closing coal power plants around me and jacking up the price of power due to high demand low supply. I would like to think we would have a alternative system in place by then but likely they will just close plants down and jack up the power rate.,alternative system;closing coal power plants;price of power,32
970,Ever been to the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico ? Don’t think it’s possible for the oil fields to be any busier than they already are and have been over the past decade. Plus the area likes its clean energy which you will also notice through the solar rooftops in every new subdivision of the booming towns.,Permian Basin region;solar rooftops,29
971,What is the most convincing argument for climate change that you give in answer to climate change sceptics ? Particularly to those people who are semi well informed i.e. who know that it used to be hotter than modern times in the past Also do you get to use your cartoon skills to draw diagrams in scientific papers ?,climate change sceptics;scientific papers,30
972,So you all that are arguing for these cars have driven them long distances ? Because not all areas are equipped with charging services and some that are have trickle charges. Was probably the worst driving experience I’ve ever had. Had to change flight plans because of some crap Ev couldn’t get be 120miles without stopping over night.,cars;charging services,26
973,Many religious leaders have degrees in divinity often advanced degrees. They are generally better educated than their conversations. They are often less dogmatic in their beliefs but don't preach that way for fear of upsetting the congregation. I imagine they probably feel a similar way about climate change since Christianity has been intertwined with right wing political beliefs.,religious leaders;right wing,35
974,When are people going to realise that we have to change to nuclear ? It's expensive at first but thinking long term it's simply the best solution for clean energy and our energy crises. The only thing that's better is fusion which isn't exactly coming soon. I guess it's because politicians doesn't think more than 4 years ahead,clean energy;fusion,29
975,Ok that’s fine .. I’m an Alaskan and have worked on several coal fire plants in Wyoming… but since this is coming from the government I want you to immediately shut down the coal fire plant running the airforce base in Fairbanks .. cease and desist immediately ! And give me a job building a new one ..,government,30
976,Yeah makes sense while the Model Y Juniper swap-over is in progress since announcement and everyone who was going to holds off on buying a Y so deliveries aren't ramped yet.

977,The Government Accountability Office said the EPA violated the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act which prohibits an agency from obligating more than $5 000 in federal funds to furnish redecorate or make improvements in the office of a presidential appointee without first notifying appropriations committees in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.,EPA;appropriations committees,35
978,"Not sure how much good this will do to actually stop climate change as Chile is a pretty small country.

980,Boom is misleading. Its only 5% of the Energy Production of China while Germany had 30% of the total Production from Nuclear Energy. Besides from that are many of the downsides of nuclear Energy in China less of a Problem then in Germany and they invest far more in renewable Energy then any other Government.,Boom;downsides of nuclear Energy in China;renewable Energy,26
981,Just disgusting I've been tracking these programs and they are brilliant just the sort of support clean energy needs and if you disagree just go look at how the federal government brought fracking to the private industry,programs,18
982,dirty energy is beyond subsidized and hurts us clean energy is our future and this delay is dumb,clean energy;dirty energy,11
983,Hi Gina why do some many EPA employees go work for the industries they regulate ? Do you approve of that ? It seems to be a conflict of interest. Wouldn't you agree ? Also why are your fines so low ? It appears any kind of EPA action is just a cost of doing business for polluters.,EPA employees;fines,24
984,If only there was something AOC could do.. You know like introduce an amendment to the clean air act that explicitly gives this regulatory authority to the EPA exactly like the court says they should o ? It's not like she's a congresswoman and thus in a position to do something like that is it ?,AOC;regulatory authority,25
985,"The problem is that that the US has failed to provide the infrastructure required to move to EV cars. There should be an EV charger at every gas station-- incentivize it to those who are gas station owners to have EV charging there. That would make the ""hassle"" of having an EV infinitely better.",US;move to EV cars,26
986,Can someone explain how all of a sudden we're talking about hydrogen as an option for clean energy in the last year or two ? Was barely mentioned before then...Or am i the only one who has noticed this ?,hydrogen,15

988,There’s been a big spike in sales here Norway in 2021 as the government are bringing in taxes on EV’s over a certain value in 2022. Of course add the fact we don’t pay import VAT and half the cost of tolls. Don’t kid yourself that if that goes. So do EV purchases.,EV purchases,25
989,Seems like everyone forgets that each state has their own version of the EPA and in some cases the states regulations are stricter than the Feds. Always seems to me like another case of federal duplicity in bureaucratic organization. we don't need two sets of environmental rules to confuse us even more !,environmental rules;federal duplicity;states regulations,29
990,"So the head of the EPA says that the very findings that the EPA found as well as other major industries is wrong ? It's like arguing that the earth is still flat and saying that it ""needs more debate"" when there is so much evidence towards what it is. It's a joke...",head of the EPA;needs more debate,22
991,In the HBO show “The Newsroom” they interviewed a climate scientist. They ask him if what he’s stating is his opinion. His response was that it isn’t an opinion any more than it’s an opinion at what temperature water boils. One of my favorite lines ever. Climate change interview from the newsroom:,Climate change interview;climate scientist,23
992,It was kind of funny because I am from western PA. When I went back to visit last year I swear I was the only one with an EV. Driving around in a bright blue Mach e I really stood out. You wouldn't start seeing EVs until you got closer to Pittsburgh.,Mach e;western PA,26
993,I hope everyone and their mom sues the EPA. They are a joke and have been for a very long time. The only way they can ever be legitimate is if you get rid of any sort of payments to the politicians and fill the board with ALL scientists.,EPA,19
994,Isn't the EPA supposed to be state regulated ? Federal power over the EPA needs to end and get it back to what it was supposed to be. Or we can just avoid that issue and say if you don't give the EPA more power then you're against the environment.,Federal power;environment,19
995,The more we invest in nuclear energy the more research and experience we can develop in order to make it even cleaner an safer than it already is. Nuclear energy may not be the center of a greener future but it sure will be an important part of it.,nuclear energy,21
996,For people unaware: EV's have One-Pedal Driving settings that mean you can control slowing down and accelerating with just the accelerator pedal. Because the motor can act as a generator when slowing you down you never need to use your brakes in normal day-to-day driving just in an emergency.,One-Pedal Driving;motor,26
997,Any time I see a large company making an announcement like this I just figure they finally did enough forecasting to realize that if the human race goes extinct due to climate change then the company's profits will suffer and so that's probably what actually drives the decision.,forecasting;large company,26
998,I’m not an expert in energy at all but I’ve been saying Nuclear Energy is almost literally the perfect green energy source for years. Objectively speaking it is nearly the perfect energy source if managed correctly. The problem is human nature and it’s capacity to go extremely wrong.,Nuclear Energy,27
999,A lot of it also has to do with the coal and power industry not wanting to absorb the cost of implementing efficiency protocols. In Illinois many modernized coal plants were shut down while other less efficient coal plants were allowed to be kept online that polluted more.,Illinois;coal and power industry;modernized coal plants,25
1000,I was willing to buy an electric F150. Until I saw the price tag. And apparently when the battery needs replacement ...it will negate all the maintenance savings. Electric vehicles are really only for a the elite at this point.,Electric vehicles,19
1001,Nuclear energy has risks but you are correct OP. Alot the concerns of nuclear energy can be solved by using thorium instead of uranium. The main issue I think is the fact that most people don't have any basic understanding of the science involved with nuclear energy.,thorium,25
1002,This is not a choice. Climate change is still very much a thing and vehicle emissions must be addressed to make a dent in that problem. We either convert to electric or give up on personal mobility entirely. Gas cars simply aren’t an option long term period.,Gas cars;vehicle emissions,27
1003,What happens to the old batteries the range isn’t very far if you think about it. There isn’t a lot of charging stations in most parts of the world. I personally think the future is going to be a hydrogen/EV hybrid type.,hybrid type,19

1008,Nobody is arguing that nuclear energy is cheap but that cost is also very one and done. After the plant is up and running the maintenance will more than pay for itself for the rest of its existence which is a long long long time.,cost;maintenance,19
1009,While this is really cool and I believe more countries should do this there is no such thing as clean energy. Everything has an impact. Solar cells are manufactured with exotic chemicals that pollute the environment. Those chemicals or precursors must also be mined.,Solar cells;clean energy,21
1010,Does anyone who thinks nuclear energy isn't safe consider how many people die every year from the pollution causes by fossil fuels ? Just because those deaths don't happen all at once in a way that captures the medias attention doesn't mean they aren't happening.,fossil fuels;nuclear energy,23
1011,The biggest reason nuclear energy isn't a panacea for climate change ? Because energy and heat production only accounts for 25% of human impact on climate.

1014,Oh no Is he going to appoint CEOs of highly polluting corporations to chair the EPA ? That agency has been the ultimate greenwash.,CEOs;EPA,12
1015,The government isn't in the business of deciding which industries succeed. Clean and extraction energy both benefit from government subsidies. If freezing funds is going to be equitable they should freeze as many extraction energy funds as they do clean energy funds.,clean energy funds;extraction energy funds,23
1016,Nuclear energy is not really in the state where people think it is anymore. Nuclear plants aren't going to give us Chernobyl. It is the way forward. The real problem would be how expensive it would be to build the plants themselves.,Nuclear energy,22
1017,I swear a similar fact is posted by some nuclear energy shill every two weeks to promote the industry. I'm not anti-nuclear and I am anti-coal but this statement alone doesn't mean that nuclear is the safer or safest energy supply.,nuclear energy,24

1031,It’s not JUST nuclear energy. It’s energy from nuclear fusion. We have been able to fuse atoms together on earth but we have not managed to release enough energy from the process that fusion can sustain itself.,nuclear fusion,17
1032,People want a gradual shift to EV’s. Right now I need to be able to get to work and back without spending 2 day’s pay just in gas… I and many other Americans can’t afford an EV.,EV,21
1033,Only issue is we need more mines. I'm all for nuclear energy but we need more fuel for it currently we don't have enough stocked but we can definitely mine for more and refine more as well,fuel;nuclear energy,14
